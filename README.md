# Electron NoteList Desktop App

This is a cross platform notelist desktop application built on electron

Built a desktop application using Electron.js This framework allows to build desktop apps using only JavaScript. I built a minimal note list app with a custom menu and multiple windows and implemented Materialize CSS for styling. I also published the app to a Mac .app file using the Electron Packager.
